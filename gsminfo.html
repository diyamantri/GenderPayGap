    <p align="justify">Globalisation has had a mixed impact on the gender pay gap in developing countries like India. While the pay gap between men and women in India decreased from 48 percent in 1993-94 to 28 percent in 2018-19, it remains significant. The growth of new economic opportunities, particularly in export-oriented industries, has not translated into equitable wages for women. Women often find themselves in lower-paying jobs and underrepresented in higher-paying sectors, which perpetuates the gender pay gap. Even in higher positions, women may earn less than their male counterparts.

            Social justice plays a crucial role in the gender pay gap in developing countries like India. Closing this gap can significantly boost global economic activity and growth. This gap costs the global economy an estimated $160 trillion annually, as women's lower incomes limit their spending on goods and services, hampering economic growth. Cultural norms that normalise women accepting lower pay contribute to this disparity. Women may face challenges in negotiation and may experience financial insecurity, potentially leading to poverty, food insecurity, and limited access to education and healthcare due to their lower earnings.

            Marginalisation is a significant factor contributing to the gender pay gap in developing countries like India. It results in women's higher vulnerability to domestic violence, as their financial dependence on men often exposes them to abuse. Women's lack of power and influence limits their participation in decision-making processes. In low-income settings like India, the emphasis on traditional family roles and caregiving responsibilities keeps women confined to unpaid domestic work, which goes unrecognised. While self-help groups (SHGs) provide women with employment opportunities, the income generated remains minimal. Despite improvements in education, societal pressures continue to marginalise women, constraining their participation in the workforce and economic empowerment.
